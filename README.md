# Yummy-FoodPandemic- Hackathon Prompt
------------------------------------------

COVID 19 is not our first health crisis, nor our last.  How do we help those at high risk? How do we create vibrant supply chains, fast vaccine testing, better PPE designs, better signage, and solutions for restaurants, stores, etc? How do we help small businesses and performers stay afloat during Shelter-in-Place?

How Yummy Food product fulfills the track for pandemic COVID-19
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This company is named Yummy Food, and it is an online food service company
aimed to help solve certain food security issues during this pandemic. 

During these trying times, restaurants, food service organizations, and regular consumers have
different issues related to food and grocery security during the COVID-19
pandemic. These problems range from the closing of restaurants, fewer options for
meals, and an increase of food waste through to lower demands of food items.


How Yummy Food is helping COVID-19
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Yummy Food is designed to help counter these current food issues by offering
online purchases from different sources and businesses.

 We will offer meals, fooditems, and groceries to restaurants, organizers,
 food banks, consumers, and other groups in need of food items. 
In addition, Yummy Food will seek and work with
farmers and local food producers/distributors to set up contacts to purchase and sell
their food products on our website. We would take care of delivery and such
matters online. 

To limit food waste as distributors of food items, we would work
with restaurants, food banks, organizers, and other groups to distribute certain food
items to people in need.
